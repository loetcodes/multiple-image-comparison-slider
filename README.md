# Using it with Your Imagery

1. Replace the images in the images/imagery directory with your images.
You can also create your own folder inside the images/ directory but remember to change the paths in the compare.js and compare.html files.

2. Open the ```compare.html``` file and locate the div with id='sliderbox'. Change the src attributes for the 'img-right' and 'img-left' to the path of the default images you would like to have as the initial slider images. 
For example, changing the initial values to ```edited.jpg``` and ```unedited.jpg``` would change the file to:

```html
    <div id="sliderbox" class="img-container">
        <!-- Right Image -->
        <img class="fitcenter" id="img_right" src="images/imagery/edited.jpg">
        <!-- Left image -->
        <div class="imgholder img-top">
            <img class="fitcenter" id="img_left" src="images/imagery/unedited.jpg">
        </div>
        <span class="handle"></span>
    </div>
```

3. All that is left at this point is to point the left and right buttons to your images. You do this by:

    a. Open the ```compare.js``` file and locate the line with, ```var filenames```.

    b. Inside this filenames, you shall put all the images you want in the slider and their button names. For example, if you have 4 images edited.jpg, unedited.jpg, filtered.jpg and unfiltered. Your filename variable should be changed to:
    ```javascript
    var filenames = [
        ['edited', 'images/imagery/edited.jpg'],
        ['filtered', 'images/imagery/filtered.jpg'],
        ['un-edited', 'images/imagery/unedited.jpg'],
        ['un-filtered', 'images/imagery/unfiltered.jpg']
    ]
    ```

    Note: For each item in the filenames array, the first item is the name that will appear on the button, eg ```'edited'``` and the second item is the path to the image, eg ```'images/imagery/edited.jpg'```.

4. Change the title of the slider in the ```compare.html```, or remove it all together if not needed. 

Once this is done, save your changes and you are good to go!
